# TASK 4
> This assignment consists of four exercises. They check the knowledge of loops.

👍 All exercises are done and checked for PEP-8.

- ## [Transpose a matrix:](https://gitlab.com/nosoccus/python-online-course-epam/-/blob/master/TASK_4/matrix.py)
### Requirements:
  * ✔️ Write the script that can transpose any matrix.
 > Note. The transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix A
by producing another matrix


> In this exercise I used ```zip``` built-in function to transpose a matrix. What about filling matrix I used simple console input element by element.


- ## [Factorial](https://gitlab.com/nosoccus/python-online-course-epam/-/blob/master/TASK_4/factorial.py)
### Requirements:
  * ✔️ Calculate the factorial for positive number n
 > Note. The factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n


> For this task I decided to implement solution my 2 methods: by loop and by recursion.


- ## [Fibonacci sequence:](https://gitlab.com/nosoccus/python-online-course-epam/-/blob/master/TASK_4/fibonacci.py)
### Requirements:
  * ✔️ For a positive integer n calculate the result value, which is equal to the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers.
 > Note. Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers in which each next number is equal to the sum of the two preceding ones


> I generate Fibonacci sequence by the recursive function to a list and then count the sum of the list.


- ## [Binary representation:](https://gitlab.com/nosoccus/python-online-course-epam/-/blob/master/TASK_4/binary.py)
### Requirements:
  * ✔️ For a positive integer n calculate the result value, which is equal to the sum of the "1" in the binary representation of n.
 > Note. Do not use any format functions
