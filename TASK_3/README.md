- ## [Exercise 2 - "FizzBuzz":](https://gitlab.com/nosoccus/python-online-course-epam/-/blob/master/TASK_3/fizzbuzz1.py)
### Requirements:
  * ‚úîÔ∏è Write a program that prints the input number from 1 to 100. But for a multiple of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".


- ## [Exercise 3 - "Baccarat":](https://gitlab.com/nosoccus/python-online-course-epam/-/blob/master/TASK_3/baccarat1.py)
### Requirements:
  * ‚úîÔ∏è Simulate the one round of play for the baccarat game:
  * ‚úîÔ∏è Rules:
   * Cards have a point value:
       * The 2 through 9 cards in each suit are worth face value (in points).
       * The 10, Jack, Queen, and King have no point value (i.e. are worth zero).
       * Aces are worth 1 point.
   * Sum the values of cards. If the total is more than 9 reduce 10 from the result. E.g. 5 + 9 = 14, 14 - 10 = 4, 4 is the result.
   * The player is not allowed to play other cards like the Joker.
