# TASK 6
> This assignment consists of two exercises. They check the knowledge of data structures.


- ## [Task 1 - Combine dicts:](https://gitlab.com/nosoccus/python-online-course-epam/-/blob/master/TASK_6/dict_merge.py)
### Requirements:
  * ✔️ Implement a function, that receives changeable number of dictionaries (keys - letters, values - numbers) and combines them into one dictionary.
  * ✔️ Dict values should be summarized in case of identical keys

- ## [Task 2 - Custom List:](https://gitlab.com/nosoccus/python-online-course-epam/-/blob/master/TASK_6/customlist.py)

 ### Condition:
 * To create generic type CustomList - the list of values, which has length that is extended when new elements are added to the list.
 * CustomList is a collection — the list of values of random type, its size changes dynamically and there is a possibility to index list elements.
 * Indexation in the list starts with 0.
 * Values of random type can be located in the list, it should be created empty and a set of original values should be specified.
 * List length changes while adding and removing elements. The elements can be added and removed using specific methods.
 * List can be checked whether there is a predetermined value in the list.

 ### Requirements:

  * To change and read values of existing elements by using indexer.
  * To receive index of predetermined value
  * To remove value based on index.
  * The list can be cleared, its length can be identified, its elements can be received in the form of linked list Item that is available via link to head.
  * Collection CustomList can be used in operator foreach and other constructions that are oriented to the presence of numerator in class.
